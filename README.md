# om-pear

does nothing but eventually...  
om-component for google-closure-grid  
https://github.com/dekajp/google-closure-grid

## Usage

TBD!

## Dev Notes

getting library via `git clone https://github.com/dekajp/google-closure-grid.git`
then just using `google-closure-grid/src/pear` and symlinking it into `lib`
per my :lib directive in project.clj

apparently some sort of `:optimizations` is needed for
google-closure-compiler to run and pickup `lib/pear`
(:none doesn't work)
